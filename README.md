# ms_stats_calculator

This project uses OCD (tesseract) to read item info from a screenshot and stores the data to Google Sheets.

The data is stored in the first page.<br/>
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RcHI5aHA_wxME7psInB9HCt1oZOTTimgqRwuaq4tWH4/edit?usp=sharing 

Other manual inputs are stored in 3rd page, and final analysis is done on the last page.
